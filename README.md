# Fullstack-Roadmap
Guide for developers or non developers who want to learn about fullstack development, usually when you start programming is not know where to start or know what is useful information and what is not 

# Introduction
To start doing things we must know the concepts and eager to learn. The fundamentals of HTML and CSS are based on two fundamental building blocks of almost everything on the web. An overview of HTML, CSS and how they work together.
# HTML and CSS
 They are two languages that work together to create everything you see when you look at something on the internet. HTML is the structure of a web page as text, links, cards, lists and buttons are created with this hypertext markup language. CSS allows you to add styles to the different elements that make up the web page. HTML puts information on a web page, and CSS, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!
 # Elements and tags
 All elements of a web page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.
Items are considered containers for content. The opening and closing tags tell the browser what content the item contains. The browser can use that information to determine how you should interpret and format the content.
Its important to use the right tags for the content. Using the right tags can have a big impact on two aspects of your websites, how they rank in search engines; and how accessible they are to users who rely on technologies, such as screen readers, to use the Internet.
Using the right elements for the content is called semantic HTML.
# DOCTYPE 
Indicates what type of document the browser should open and what syntax and grammar its source code uses.

# DOCTYPE html
Often the tag is forgotten, although this is one of the most important elements of an HTML document. Since today its presence is taken for granted, we should not forget to indicate the type of document of each page.

# Head element
The head element provides general information called metadata about the document, including its title and links to scripts and stylesheets.

# Meta
Meta tags control how search engines should crawl and index content. 
# Body
 The body tag is used to render and display the content of a website to users.
# Paragraph or p element
element p represents a paragraph. A paragraph is a block of text consisting of one or more sentences that refer to a particular topic and are normally separated from others by a blank space
# Headings
Headings ( headers) help both users and search engines read and understand the texts that make up a website. They act as indicators for readers and make it easier for people to understand what a publication or page is about.

# Emphasis Bold and Italic Text
strong tags are use to make text bold
em tags are use to make text italic
A common error is to think that tags b and i are the same as strong
and em tags but dont add any important to the text, it doesnt add meaning to the text is just a visual representation.

# Anchor or a element
The Anchor Element creates a link to other web pages, files or locations within the same page, email addresses, or any other URL

# Absolute or relative path
The absolute path represents the full path of the resource, part of the root directory to the specific file being searched. For its part, the relative path represents only part of the path, since it takes into account the current directory from which you are working.

# Image tags
 img tag is used with one or more attributes. The basic way to use this tag is: img src="url". Where the src (Source) attribute contains a url as its value. This url indicates the address and name of the image to be inserted.
