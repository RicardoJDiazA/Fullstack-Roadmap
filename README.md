# Introduction
To start doing things we must know the concepts and eager to learn. The fundamentals of HTML and CSS are based on two fundamental building blocks of almost everything on the web. An overview of HTML, CSS and how they work together.
# HTML and CSS
 They are two languages that work together to create everything you see when you look at something on the internet. HTML is the structure of a web page as text, links, cards, lists and buttons are created with this hypertext markup language. CSS allows you to add styles to the different elements that make up the web page. HTML puts information on a web page, and CSS, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!
 # Elements and tags
 All elements of a web page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.
Items are considered containers for content. The opening and closing tags tell the browser what content the item contains. The browser can use that information to determine how you should interpret and format the content.
Its important to use the right tags for the content. Using the right tags can have a big impact on two aspects of your websites, how they rank in search engines; and how accessible they are to users who rely on technologies, such as screen readers, to use the Internet.
Using the right elements for the content is called semantic HTML.
