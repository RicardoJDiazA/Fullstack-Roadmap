# Fullstack-Roadmap
Guide for developers or non developers who want to learn about fullstack development, usually when you start programming is not know where to start or know what is useful information and what is not 

# Introduction
To start doing things we must know the concepts and eager to learn. The fundamentals of HTML and CSS are based on two fundamental building blocks of almost everything on the web. An overview of HTML, CSS and how they work together.
# HTML and CSS
 They are two languages that work together to create everything you see when you look at something on the internet. HTML is the structure of a web page as text, links, cards, lists and buttons are created with this hypertext markup language. CSS allows you to add styles to the different elements that make up the web page. HTML puts information on a web page, and CSS, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!
 # Elements and tags
 All elements of a web page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.
Items are considered containers for content. The opening and closing tags tell the browser what content the item contains. The browser can use that information to determine how you should interpret and format the content.
Its important to use the right tags for the content. Using the right tags can have a big impact on two aspects of your websites, how they rank in search engines; and how accessible they are to users who rely on technologies, such as screen readers, to use the Internet.
Using the right elements for the content is called semantic HTML.
# DOCTYPE 
Indicates what type of document the browser should open and what syntax and grammar its source code uses.

# DOCTYPE html
Often the tag is forgotten, although this is one of the most important elements of an HTML document. Since today its presence is taken for granted, we should not forget to indicate the type of document of each page.

# Head element
The head element provides general information called metadata about the document, including its title and links to scripts and stylesheets.

# Meta
Meta tags control how search engines should crawl and index content. 
# Body
 The body tag is used to render and display the content of a website to users.
